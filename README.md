## Architecture Overview
- **UI Layer:** Built with Flutter's Material components, supporting both light and dark themes.
- **Chat Logic:** `chat_screen.dart` manages chat state, message rendering, speech controls, and user interactions.
- **Speech Services:** `speech_service.dart` abstracts speech-to-text and text-to-speech, supporting voice input/output.
- **API Integration:** `api_service.dart` communicates with a backend AI (default: [info-assistant-qhctotcy8-reggie-s-projects.vercel.app](https://info-assistant-qhctotcy8-reggie-s-projects.vercel.app)), sending user queries and chat history for context-aware answers.
- **Firebase:** Used for initialization and extensibility (analytics, auth, etc. can be added).
